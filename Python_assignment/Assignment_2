1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans1-The two values of Boolean data type is True or False, Boolean expressions use relational and logical operators. The result of a Boolean expression is either true or false.


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

Ans2- and , or , and not.


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Ans3-True and True is True.

True and False is False.

False and True is False.

False and False is False.

True or True is True.

True or False is True.

False or True is True.

False or False is False.

not True is False.

not False is True.

True is 1 and False is 0

Truth Table for AND
A B output
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1

Truth Table for OR
A B output
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1

Truth Table for NOT
A output
0 1
1 0


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)    
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

print((5 > 4) and (3 == 5))    
print(not (5 > 4))
print((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
print(not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)))
print((True and True) and (True == False))
print((not False) or (not True))



5. What are the six comparison operators?

Ans5-The six comparison operators are equal to, not equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to.



6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans6-(==)is the equal to symbol it which it compares the 2 values,whether it is equal(same) or not
(x=2) is the assignment operator in which we are assigning 2 to the variable x

5==4   #-Equal to

x=2    #Assignment operator
x


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs') #Block 1
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon') #Block 2
else:
    print('ham') #Block 3
    print('spam')
    print('spam')




8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input("Input a no."))
if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")
    
    

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Ans- If program is stuck in endless loop we will press ctrl+c.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

# use of break
for i in range(10):
    if(i==7):
        break
    print(i)
    
print('Breaked')
#use of  continue
for i in range(10):
    if(i==7):
        continue
    print(i)

Break-As the statemnt is True at particular point its break and come out of the loop .It called as stop 
Continue-If the condition is given,if it trues then it just skip the particular satement and then it continues.Its called as skip

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans11-As 3 of then gives same output,but range(10) has no start value so by default it takes 0 and end at 9(excluding 10)
range(0,10)-It has the start value ,even it print 0 to 9(excluding 10)
range(0,10,1)-It start from 0 and and end at 9(excluding 10) but step size is given as 1
(start_value,end_value,step_size)

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

#for loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

#while loop
a=1
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

This function can be called with spam.bacon()
