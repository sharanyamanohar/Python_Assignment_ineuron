    "\n",
    "Ans-Python is the programming Language used to built websites,software,automated task ,data analytics purpose,etc.Nowadays python is well used Programming language because it is very easy to code compared to other language.It can be used for any problem in which it is not generalised to particular problem statement.It is free to use,it supports object oriented programming language.It has lot of libraries,even it has lot of in built data structures.It uses AI,ML,data analytics ,data vizualization,etc and even there is widely application with python"

    "\n",
    "Ans-A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as the parent class or base class. In the above example, Vehicle is the Superclass and its subclasses are Car.The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well."
